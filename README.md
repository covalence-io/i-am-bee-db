# IMBDB

## A.K.A. I'm (the) Bee Database

This is a fully fledged full-stack app _without_ auth yet for students to get some extra auth practice.

It maintains a list of user accounts, a list of bee species, and users will create log entries out bee sightings.

## Getting Started

-   Run `npm install` to get your dependencies

-   Grab the script at [starter.sql](./starter.sql) to create the tables and pre-populate them with some data (the 1 user account for Buzz Lightyear has a plaintext password of `password123`);

-   Copy the [.env.sample](./.env.sample) file to a new `.env` file, filling it out with _your_ database user and database password.
